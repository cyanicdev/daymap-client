# Daymap Client

### What is this?
An awesome Daymap client we're working on! In time you'll be able to check your daily feed, view your timetable, ignore messages, and look at your grades like never before.

### So it's better than Daymap?
Official Daymap will always have more features, but we have a UI that's not trash.

### How can I download it?
Once we reach mvp we'll be releasing builds for Windows, Linux and Mac (ahh, the convenience of electron).

### Wait, I go to *less superior highschool*, can I still use this?
Hypothetically it should work, but with different schools using slightly different versions of Daymap, things are a bit too prone to break for us to officially support different schools. That said, if you're savvy enough to get it working at your school without problem, feel free to submit a pull request!



## Installation

It's easy peasy! Just clone the repo, cd into it, and install all dev dependencies like so!
```
cd daymap-client
npm install
```

Then just start the engine
```
npm start
```
